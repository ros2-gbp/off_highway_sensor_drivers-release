  * Add missing dependency on PCL headers (#9)
    When I try to build this package on jazzy with rosdep, the PCL headers
    are missing. This package uses find_package(PCL) and includes it in
    the headers. Therefore I think it would be best to add it to the
    build_depend and build_export_depend tags of the package.xml
    files.
    In the buildfarm this is technically not needed because the PCL headers
    are a build_export_depend of pcl_conversions, but rosdep ignores
    this dependency so it misses the PCL headers.

  * Rename premium radar driver to sample
    Currently, the delivered Radar Off-Highway Premium and its firmware are just samples.
    Separate package will be created for series firmware.
  * Switch from deprecated signature to const shared_ptr reference while still supporting efficient intra-process communication
    See https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1598.
  * Interpret azimuth and elevation angle of premium radar locations as cone coordinates
  * Update executable names for premium radar in launch
  * Convert premium radar from node to component
  * Remove redundant normal in pcl
